# WebsiteToPrompt Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-01-18_

WebsiteToPrompt is an open-source Chrome extension that helps users select, store, and transform webpage elements into prompts for ChatGPT. This policy describes how WebsiteToPrompt (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information gathered through the extension.

We strive to adhere to relevant privacy laws, including (where applicable) the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). By using WebsiteToPrompt, you agree to the practices outlined below.

---

## 1. Introduction

We are responsible for all user data under our control. We have designated individuals responsible for ensuring compliance with this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about how your data is handled, please see the [Contact Information](#10-handling-user-questions-and-contacts) below.

---

## 2. Purpose of Collection

Our extension’s primary purpose is to:
- Let you select snippets of text or elements on any website you visit.
- Convert those snippets into a clean, structured format (such as Markdown).
- Allow you to save and manage those snippets in a private, local dashboard.

We only collect or store the minimum data needed for this functionality. No additional data is gathered without your consent. In some cases, the need for data collection is self-evident (for example, storing your snippet selections in local storage).

---

## 3. Consent

Using WebsiteToPrompt is voluntary. By installing and using the extension, you consent to our collection and storage of the data you explicitly select (i.e., the text or web elements you choose to save). If you do not provide or allow us to save this information, certain extension features will not be available.

We do not use or share any collected information for unrelated purposes without your consent, unless required by law.

---

## 4. Limiting Collection

We only collect:
- **Selected Content**: The text or webpage elements you manually choose via “Selection Mode” for transformation and saving.
- **Extension Usage Data (Analytics)**: Anonymous event data (e.g., toggling selection mode, opening the dashboard) via Google Analytics to understand extension usage and improve functionality. This data does **not** include personal identifiers.

We do not automatically gather additional information such as your name, email address, or other personally identifiable data.

---

## 5. Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention

We do not sell or share your stored snippets or usage data with third parties, except:
- **Local Storage**: Your chosen website content is stored locally in your browser. You may view or delete it at any time through our dashboard interface.  
- **Analytics**: We send non-personal, anonymous usage information (e.g., event counts) to Google Analytics servers. This helps us understand which features are most helpful.  

Your selected snippets remain stored until you remove them or uninstall the extension. We will retain anonymous usage data in compliance with Google Analytics policies.

---

## 6. Accuracy of Data

You control which snippets to save and can edit or remove them whenever you want. We rely on you to ensure that the text you select is the information you want stored. We do not modify snippet content.

---

## 7. Safeguarding User Information

We use Chrome’s local storage and standard security features provided by the Chrome Extension platform:
- Snippets are stored locally on your device; no external server hosts your data.
- Access to your data is protected by Chrome’s extension framework.

We take reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of your locally stored data. However, the security of information relies partly on you ensuring your computer and browser are kept secure.

---

## 8. Openness About Policies and Practices

We keep our users informed about our data handling through this Privacy Policy. Updates or changes to the policy will be reflected in the same GitHub repository where this document is maintained.

---

## 9. Accessing and Managing Your Data

Because snippet data is stored locally, you can:
- **View** it in the WebsiteToPrompt dashboard.
- **Delete** it individually or clear all stored snippets at any time.
- **Remove** the extension from your browser, which deletes the local storage associated with it.

We do not maintain copies of your snippet data on our servers. If you believe your data has been used or stored incorrectly, see our [Contact Information](#10-handling-user-questions-and-contacts).
