# WebsiteToPrompt

A Chrome extension that lets you select HTML elements on a webpage (via a simple inspect-like tool) and compile them into Markdown. The extension **automatically saves** these selections as "prompts," which you can then manage, export, or delete in the new **Prompt Management Dashboard**.

## Features

1. **Selection Mode**:

   - Toggle from the extension popup or context menu.
   - Hover/click on elements in the current tab to capture them.
   - Captured elements are automatically converted to Markdown and stored.

2. **WebsiteToPrompt Dashboard**:

   - Open via popup button or context menu: "Open WebsiteToPrompt Dashboard."
   - View, search, delete, or export your saved prompts.
   - Each prompt includes a timestamp, URL, element path, HTML, and generated Markdown.

3. **Auto-Save**:
   - On each selected element, the extension auto-saves prompt data to `chrome.storage.local`.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Visit `chrome://extensions/` in Google Chrome (or another Chromium-based browser).

## How to Use

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
